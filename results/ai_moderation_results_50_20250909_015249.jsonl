And Republicans sense a chink in the new president's armor.\n\"I'm sure that democrats, or at least the president is embarrassed by some of this,\" said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.\nAll sides now agree the President's stimulus bill won't survive in the form passed last week by House of Representatives (with only Democrats voting in favor).\nSupporters say that bill would create 3 million jobs. Detractors say it merely fulfills a long wish list of Democratic social reforms.\nA CBS News analysis finds that the resident's stimulus plan balloons virtually every federal agency in terms of dollars spent: $5.5 billion more for the Department of Commerce, $9.4 billion extra for the Environmental Protection Agency, $5 billion more for Labor, $1 billion for the Census and nearly $36 billion for Agriculture.\nAnd what about HHS, the agency Tom Daschle was slated to head before his withdrawal today? At least $21 billion for them, including $400 million for research, $60 million for environmental health, $50 million for \"injury prevention\" and to be distributed at the discretion of the HHS secretary.\nAll that has Republicans reaching for new ways to express numbers that defy imagination.\n\"If you took 100 dollar bills and wrapped them around the earth at the equator … It would go around the earth almost 39 times,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.\nThe president has been friendly enough, inviting some Republicans to cocktails, lunch and a Super Bowl party, even meeting with the Republican caucus on their own turf in the Capitol.\nBut the charm offensive hasn't risen above the political reality: Republicans were shut out of creating what's become \"The largest spending package probably ever in the history of the world,\" in the words of Republican Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C.\nToday, Senate Republicans began the push for what they call a simpler, more targeted stimulus bill.\nIt's a bout half the size of Mr. Obama's plan, much of which would be tax cuts and, they say, money that would address the mortgage crisis first.\n© 2009 CBS.

Poorer countries aren’t.\nAnd poor ones do. How did that happen?\nSmoke rises from the cooling towers of coal-fired Cottam Power Station near Darlton, England, on April 17, 2015.\nThe United Kingdom announced last week its ambition to phase out the burning of coal by 2025. “Frankly, it cannot be satisfactory for an advanced economy like the U.K. to be relying on polluting, carbon-intensive 50-year-old coal-fired power stations,” Energy Secretary Amber Rudd said. Coal, which in the second quarter of 2015 accounted for just 21 percent of the U.K.’s electricity, will be replaced by natural gas and renewables, unless coal-burning plants can figure out an effective way to capture carbon emissions.\nBut this move is more than symbolic. When a nation of 64.1 million people, the fifth-largest economy in the world, announces that it will boycott a product—any product—it has significant and immediate knock-on effects. In this case, it contributes to a largely unnoticed trend that is emerging both in the U.S. and across the globe. Increasingly, coal has become a class-based energy source. Wealthy regions, states, and cities are figuring out how to avoid using it, while poorer geographic areas are not.\nThe U.K.’s move to go coalless will take less than 1 percent of global demand off the market. And as shocking as it seems, huge chunks of the world have yet to be adequately electrified. Many of the power plants that will turn on lights and run computers in India, China, and Africa in the coming decades will be fueled by coal. If India’s coal consumption—744 million short tons in 2014—were to increase by just 10 percent, it would more than make up for the loss of England.\nSo why is this economically significant news? Coal is a commodity, but it’s not as easily fungible as many others. Substantial investments went into the infrastructure (often financed by debt) that enables the movement of coal from where it’s mined to where it’s used today. (Hello, stranded assets!) And significant investments will be required to move coal from where it’s mined to where it will be used tomorrow. You can’t just flip a switch in a pipeline and start shipping coal to Mumbai instead of Middlesbrough.\nWhich is why even a relatively small reduction in consumption can have disproportionate impacts on individual companies and on national industries. In the U.S., for example, cheap natural gas and higher environmental standards (in that order) are slowly reducing coal’s footprint in the energy mix. We’re also seeing a lot of demand destruction; the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign is documenting all the coal-burning plants that have closed or are slated for closure. Coal consumption in the U.S. fell by 19 percent between 2007 and 2014. That’s a lot. But the Dow Jones U.S. Coal Index, which tracks the performance of U.S. coal stocks, is off about 95 percent since April 2011. That’s catastrophic.\nThere’s another important point to keep in mind. Whatever you make—coal, watches, chocolate, cars— it’s really important to have wealthy people and wealthy countries that are willing to buy it. And not just because that’s where the money is. As the U.K. transitions away from coal, it will invest lots of money in replacements like natural gas, solar, wind, and energy efficiency. As it does so, it will create infrastructure, processes, and products that may help bring the cost of noncoal energy technologies down further.\nIn 2012, China and India combined to account for about 56 percent of global coal consumption. That percentage is climbing with each passing month. A world in which the U.K. is using no coal and the U.S. is using much less coal than it is now—and in which China and India account for the bulk of consumption—is one in which the prospects for a tax on carbon emissions, or taxes on coal imports and exports, or supra-regional cap-and-trade regimes, or limits on emissions from industries will become far more common.\nSo the major consequence isn’t just the real demand destruction and economic dislocation that will come from the U.K. boycotting coal. Shorn of their dependence on the stuff for cheap power, the world’s wealthy will use their power and money to embrace technologies, policies, and geopolitics that further tilt the table against coal. They already are.\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents © 2019 The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."}

That means I get to be a hero again — showing up at the winner’s door, ready to give away $1,000,000.00! Imagine … me … a hero. No one’s ever put it that way to me before, but now my seal won’t stop glowing with excitement thinking about how I can save the day for our next Special Early Look event winner!\nWould $1,000,000.00 Save You From Debt … Save Your Home … Or Just Save You From Worrying?

These individuals have translated their campus experience as student-athletes into success in all walks of life including medicine, science, politics, business and sports.\nSince 1896, the Big Ten has provided opportunities for students to earn a first-rate education. Ten member institutions rank in the top 31 of all public universities, and the Big Ten leads all conferences with more than 1,500 Academic All-Americans.&nbsp; Big Ten Medal of Honor winners embody this scholastic tradition and represent continued success following their education.\nAs part of the Big Ten Medal of Honor’s historic anniversary, the conference is launching a 100-day campaign to help announce this year’s honorees and celebrate the prominent winners of the past 99 years. The integrated effort, which begins this week and extends through June 18, includes profiling notable winners and stories each day on social channels and the conference website. Big Ten on-campus celebrations will feature past award recipients, recognition ceremonies and promotion of the award campus-wide.\nThe Best of the BestOut of the more than 8,200 student-athletes at the 12 Big Ten institutions, only 24 are recognized each year with the Big Ten Medal of Honor.\nTo learn more about the Big Ten Medal of Honor, visit bigten.org.

It is very close to the AI in BP: WiH with some added FSO 3.6.13 features. Especially AI controlled ships that have firing points far apart will greatly benefit from this AI. Readme included, so read it before whining. All hail Sushi and SCP.\nIt's not a big update from WiH, only minor tweaks and addition of FSO 3.6.13 features which aren't groundbreaking.

I guess he just put too many ships with those in one mission, this is usually what you get for going overboard with that kind of thing. IIRC, Fury's AI makes AI ships fire much faster than retail, even on Normal, which is why it showed up now (I'm supposed to be testing it on Insane, but I just can't get myself to fly these days.

Integrate with JIRA to track and manage issues from the console.\nToday, several members of the Lucid Software team returned from San Francisco after a successful journey to AWS Summit. Over the last two days, they stayed busy meeting Lucidchart enthusiasts (and future Lucidchart enthusiasts) at our booth. When evening rolled around and other booths packed up, they stuck around to hand out swag and chat about the benefits of our web-based diagramming software.\nHowever, our team was able to stop by the keynote address from Werner Vogels, the CTO at Amazon.com and hear about some exciting developments, including a big launch involving Lucidchart. Read our take on the top announcements from AWS Summit.\nAWS Marketplace currently offers over 3,800 software listings and boasts 135,000 active customers, and Amazon’s first big announcement will likely earn the AWS Marketplace new fans. With SaaS Contracts, you can now purchase your favorite software—including Lucidchart!—directly through AWS Marketplace. This addition gives you greater flexibility for subscriptions: Set the number of users and length of your contract, upgrade/expand your contracts at any time, and view the charges right on your AWS bill.\nAmazon expects to offer even more options over the next few months, but we’re happy to be one of the first 20 sellers to release a product as part of this launch. In addition to its intuitive nature and collaborative features, every Lucidchart account (including accounts purchased through AWS) includes our AWS import tool. Save time as you design your network and demonstrate compliance by importing your AWS infrastructure into Lucidchart. View additional metadata about each component, and see all connected components when you drag a shape onto the canvas.\nFor more information about Lucidchart SaaS Contacts, read our press release.\nIf you haven’t purchased our diagramming tool yet, now is the time! Check out our listing on AWS Marketplace.\nGreat news—this next announcement deals with the pain you’ve felt as you set up new project environments and tried to collaborate with other team members. Collaboration is obviously near and dear to our hearts at Lucid Software, so we were excited to see Amazon’s solution: AWS CodeStar.\nOnce you’ve developed a responsive development workflow using AWS CodeStar, don’t forget to visualize and store that process for future reference. Try it with Lucidchart.\nAmazon launched Redshift, a data warehousing service, back in 2012. While Redshift can hold an enormous amount of data, it takes time to load all that data and provide optimal query performance. So Amazon announced Redshift Spectrum, an extension of this popular service that customers can use to run complex queries directly on data stored in Amazon S3.\nEssentially, Redshift Spectrum offers a faster, more economical option for large-scale data queries. Vogels explained that an exabyte (that’s one billion gigabytes) of data took five years for an older data warehouse to query, which costs a lot of money. With Spectrum, it takes 155 seconds to run the query.\nWe use Redshift at Lucid, and we have put a lot of time and effort into building tools to transfer data from S3 into Redshift and rebuilding data when clusters inevitably go down. Redshift Spectrum will save us time as we continue to build out our analytics infrastructure. Better performance. Lower cost. We love it, and so will you.\nAmazon has taken a few more steps forward in the world of artificial intelligence. Last year, when we went to AWS re:Invent, Amazon launched Amazon Lex as a preview. As of yesterday, it’s available to all users so you too can harness the technology that makes Amazon Alexa run. Use automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) to build applications that support lifelike conversation.\nSince the launch last December, Amazon has added some new features to Lex, including Slack and Twilio integrations, SDK support, and preview response cards. For more information on these features, check out Amazon’s announcement.\nThese updates are just another way that AWS has provided users with the necessary tools to focus less on the small stuff (like managing servers) and more on their businesses. We have to agree with Vogels—if you are the James Bond of DevOps, then AWS is your intelligent, ever-helpful Q.\nIf you’re looking for another way to make the most of your AWS experience, remember that you can semi-automatically build network diagrams of your AWS infrastructure in Lucidchart. Check out our free e-book to learn more.\nShannon Williams graduated from BYU in English and then turned to the world of marketing. She works as a content marketing specialist at Lucid Software.

Wang and his family in 1998, the annual award recognizes four outstanding faculty members and one staff member in the CSU system who have distinguished themselves through exemplary achievements in various academic disciplines.\nLove founded Metro in partnership with City College in 2007 after noticing that many students entering the public health education major didn’t have the tools they needed to succeed. With help from Vicki Legion, her counterpart at City College and director of the Metro Transfer Success program there, Love reconfigured the first two years of college. Metro creates student communities with shared academic or career interests in a “school within a school” for up to 140 first generation, low-income or underrepresented students each year. The cohort of students enrolls together in two linked general education classes each semester during those two years. An engaging curriculum uses real-world challenges to strengthen the core academic skills of writing, quantitative reasoning, oral communications and critical thinking.\n“Critical thinking and writing are skills that improve with repeated practice over time,” said Love. “This curriculum provides students with the time and support they need to do that.” Love says the curriculum empowers students to use their education to improve not only their own lives but also those of people in their communities and broader society. “We want to impart a love of learning and help them build a secure sense of self as scholars and agents of change,” said Love. By discovering how learning is relevant to them and their families, the students become more excited about learning.", "labels_spam": 0, "labels_spam_vector": {"keyword_spam": 0, "malicious_links": 0, "ads": 0}}

In the code I pasted above, I did something different. As you can see, I switched the order of the two so that $name would be equals to $first_name first, and then get updated in line 14 if the condition is true, thus avoiding the \"else\" statement.\nif the condition is == TRUE, like in this case, even though I think the code in the \"if\" statement in line 14 SHOULDN'T run, it runs, and the result is still \"Hampton Paulk\". And it remains \"Hampton Paulk\" no matter if the condition is set to TRUE or FALSE.\nIf the condition is ===TRUE, the opposite occurs. It doesn't matter whether you define \"USE_FULL_NAME\" as TRUE or FALSE, the condition in line 14 NEVER runs, and the name is just \"Hampton\" in both cases.\nif I set the condition == FALSE and set the USE_FULL_NAME to TRUE, the program works as intended. It displays the first name \"Hampton\" only. But if I set USE_FULL_NAME to FALSE, the condition should be met and it should display \"Hampton Paulk\", yet it doesn't, and it only displays \"Hampton\" regardless.\nWhy does this happen? What am I getting wrong in the order of operation?\nHi Marco, Did you noticed that your global variable is different: USE_FULL-NAME (hyphen '-') than global which was checked in the conditional statement: USE_FULL_NAME (underscore '_')?\nIt could be an explanation why this doesn't work as expected.

{"uid": "04f4a797a47e8330b12e5df3e77684f5", "content": "Overview Over-pronation, or flat feet, is a common biomechanical problem that occurs in the walking process when a person?s arch collapses upon weight bearing. This motion can cause extreme stress or inflammation on the plantar fascia, possibly causing severe discomfort and leading to other foot problems. Causes There may be several possible causes of over pronation. The condition may begin as early as birth. However, there are several more common explanations for the condition. First, wear and tear on the muscles throughout the foot, either from aging or repetitive strain, causes the muscles to weaken, thereby causing the foot to turn excessively inward. Also, standing or walking on high heels for an extended period of time also places strain and pressure on the foot which can weaken the tissue. Lastly, shoes play a very common factor in the development of over pronation. Shoes that fail to provide adequate support through the arch commonly lead to over pronation. Symptoms Not all foot injuries affecting runners are necessarily down to a particular running gait; it is rarely that simple to diagnose how a foot problem developed . Simply being an overpronator does not mean that a foot injury has been caused by the running gait and it could be due to a number of factors. However mild to severe overpronators tend to be at a higher risk of developing musculoskeletal problems due to the increased stresses and strains which are placed on the body when the foot does not move in an optimum manner. The following injuries are frequently due to overpronation of the feet. Tarsal tunnel syndrome. Shin splints. Anterior compartment syndrome. Plantar fasciitis. Achilles tendonitis. Bunions. Sesamoiditis. Stress fractures. Back and hip pain. Ankle pain. Diagnosis A quick way to see if you over-pronate is to look for these signs. While standing straight with bare feet on the floor, look so see if the inside of your arch or sole touches the floor. Take a look at your hiking or running shoes; look for wear on the inside of the sole. Wet your feet and walk on a surface that will show the foot mark. If you have a neutral foot you should see your heel connected to the ball of your foot by a mark roughly half of width of your sole. If you over-pronate you will see greater than half and up to the full width of your sole. Non Surgical Treatment Overpronation is a term used to describe excessive flattening of the plantar arch. Pronation is a normal part of our gait (the way we walk), and it comprises three movements: dorsiflexion, eversion, and abduction. Dorsiflexion is the upward movement of the foot, eversion describes the foot rolling in, and abduction is ?out toeing,? meaning your toes are moving away from the midline of your body. When these three motions are extreme or excessive, overpronation results. Overpronation is very common in people who have flexible flat feet. Flatfoot, or pes planus, is a condition that causes collapse of the arch during weight bearing. This flattening puts stress on the plantar fascia and the bones of the foot, resulting in pain and further breakdown. Prevention Strengthen the glutes to slow down the force of the foot moving too far inward. Most individuals who over-pronate have weak glute muscles and strengthening this area is a must. A simple exercise to strengthen glutes is lateral tube walking across a field/court/room. Place a lateral stretch band around your ankles and move your leg sideways while keeping your feet forward.", "labels_spam": 0, "labels_spam_vector": {"keyword_spam": 0, "malicious_links": 0, "ads": 0}}

Seeing no other employment prospects for him, they taught him to beg on the streets.\nThings changed 20 years ago when Tishale met his wife. The love of a good woman helped him turn his life around; he taught himself to read and write and dedicated his life to developing his woodworking skills.\nTishale now sticks out in his community more for his talent than for his appearance. But he's had to make some adaptations. He rides a specially adapted bicycle to get around and must limit himself to making certain types of furniture.\n\"Because of my physical limitations I can only make small pieces of furniture, stools and chests of drawers,\" he said. \"I sit on the floor so that I can stretch my legs out as far as possible.\nTishale is proud that he never let his disability hinder him from being a productive member of society and wants others in his situation to realize they have value beyond their disabilities. He's considered building a school.\nTishale's story is especially poignant to people like Tom Willis, who was born without any arms -- just a small left hand with two fingers that aren't very strong.\nBut that hasn't stopped him from leading a successful life, first as a producer of educational films and currently as a motivational speakerwho has made it his goal to throw out the first ball at every Major League Baseball stadium -- with his feet.\nWillis says that even though he grew up in the U.S., where there are more opportunities for the disabled than in Ethiopia, his story and Tishale's aren't so different.\n\"If you go in my garage you'll find power tools as well -- table saw, drill press, etc. -- I'm not the greatest, but I've built a few things in my day, too,\" he said.\nWillis says Tishale's story does help raise awareness in countries like Ethiopia that a disability doesn't mean a person has no value, but he adds it's hard to overcome a misconception that is centuries old.\nREAL LIFE.

The Alaafin said the rulers understood the financial situation of the country but needed to be provided with firsthand information on how the state was being run.\n“We were not invited for the budget presentation. If the government proposes to spend N165 billion in 2016 and the state is not financially buoyant, we want to know how government intends to generate the needed income to finance the budget expenditure.\n“For about three months, traditional rulers have not been getting funds from government. Though we recognize the current financial crisis in the nation, we are here to find out how the governor has been able to regularly pay the salaries and emoluments of members of the Council of Obas until the last three months.\nThe monarch applauded the governor for running the state without excessive borrowing.\nGovernor Ajimobi in his response urged the traditional rulers to encourage their subjects to pay tax as the state was projecting generating N5billion internally. He said that way, here would be no problem paying the salaries of the traditional rulers.\n“We have identified companies that have not paid tax for five years. Many house owners don’t pay tenement rate. So, traditional rulers have to help speak to their people on the need to pay tax.\nMeanwhile, the Alaafin threw a lavished party when he turned 77 this year. He had a swell time with his teenaged wife who is also his last wife.\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION!

As the nine-day mission proceeded, audio from mission control captured the drama as it unfolded— each moment revealing new dangers, new decisions and new wonders. For the first time on television, this documentary utilizes “lost tapes” of the astronauts, recorded before and after the mission, along with rare film and photos.\nThe Americans were not the only ones trying for the moon in July of 1969...the Soviets were there, too. President Nixon had already prepared a eulogy for the possible death of the astronauts on their mission to the moon.\nThe documentary reveals the doubts and fears of the astronauts as they stood on the brink of history. The mission was nearly aborted twice, as the crew faced a mysterious alarm sounding in the spacecraft, and when fuel levels ran dangerously low.", "labels_spam": 0, "labels_spam_vector": {"keyword_spam": 0, "malicious_links": 0, "ads": 0}}

We both stayed in a private room and dorm. Both were great! The rooms are simple and maybe not the most fun but everything is clean. The staff are great and super helpful. I did the spring roll cooking class which was amazing! The atmosphere was overall great at the hostel. Would really recommend!\nBästa hostelet på hela min Vietnam resa, än så länge ! Super trevlig personal! Och så kul med olika events varje dag. Rekommenderar det till alla som gillar att möta nya människor och festa till det! Helt klart värt ett besök. 😍 Amazing!\nThe staff were so nice and helpful, and the breakfast buffet was amazing. Worth going there for only their pancakes! The bar was also fun and social and they have a free shuttle to a club every night.\nLoved this place! The rooms and furniture was a little outdated but nothing that changed our feelings toward this hostel. It was during tet so a lot of things were generally closed but we still had an amazing time. They had drink deals every night and a pubcrawl leaving at certain nights. Social hostel!\nNice with activities every day and good vibes. You are like friends with the crew. Great party and things to do.\nThe location was very good. Close to old town. And the stuff very kind and helpful! They seems also to have a lot of social activities and group trips! And also good breakfast! But he room was soso. Stayed in a room at the bottom floor which was quite noisy though it's close to both reception and bar. So earplugs is a must for those who wanna have a good sleep. The bathroom was ok. Shower and toilet in same area so if someone showers it's became pretty wet at floor.", "labels_spam": 0, "labels_spam_vector": {"keyword_spam": 0, "malicious_links": 0, "ads": 0}}

It was reportedly the first major strike of Amazon workers in the U.S. during Prime Day, one of the company’s biggest sales events of the year.\nThis year’s Prime Day, which spans Monday and Tuesday, could rake in an estimated $5.8 billion in sales globally.\nSupporters of the picketers have reminded consumers that buying anything from Amazon on Prime Day would be crossing a digital picket line.\nPhotos taken outside the Shakopee warehouse show a few dozen protesters holding signs with phrases like “We’re human, not robots.” Some 100 to 200 workers had been expected to join the strike, which lasted six hours starting at 3 p.m. on Monday; but strikers claimed managers had intimidated workers from joining the walkout.\nThe Minnesota workers weren’t the only ones to use Prime Day as an emphatic way to make their grievances with Amazon known.\nSome 2,000 Amazon workers at seven facilities in Germany walked out in protest of poor working conditions and low wages, CNBC reported. Amazon had said earlier that the German strike would not impact deliveries to customers.\nDemonstrations also took place in several American cities, including New York, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle, where Amazon’s headquarters is located, to press the retail giant to stop selling technology to U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.\nThe Seattle Times noted that the U.K., Spain and Poland had Prime Day protests of their own.\nAmazon has repeatedly come under scrutiny over the years for subjecting warehouse workers to punishing working conditions, including instituting unreasonable quotas and making it difficult for employees to take adequate breaks or use the restroom.\nEarlier this month, late night host John Oliver devoted the majority of his show to calling out the retail giant for its questionable worker policies.\nAt the Shakopee facility, striking workers have expressed similar complaints.\nMeg Brady, a “rebinner” at the warehouse, told The Washington Post this week that she’s expected to handle 600 items per hour ― a physically demanding task that she said caused a stress fracture in her foot.\n“They’re working under insane deadlines, often in unsafe conditions,” Liz Shuler of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations said in a statement of the Minnesota workers.\n“We’re standing strong in solidarity with the workers in Shakopee and beyond, but we hope you will too. When you stand up together collectively, that is how we change corporate behavior,” she continued.\nAs CNBC noted, many workers at the Shakopee facility ― the majority of whom are East African ― have also complained that Amazon has been unwilling to accommodate their religious practices and holidays.\nStrike organizers said they want Amazon to “provide safe and reliable jobs, increase respect and opportunities for advancement for the predominantly East African workforce” and “protect the right to organize and advocate for better working conditions,” among other demands.\n“[In] fact we already offer the things they purport to be their cause — industry leading pay of $15 per hour, benefits, and a safe workplace for our employees,” the company said in an earlier statement.\nAn Amazon spokesman told HuffPost on Tuesday that “roughly 15 associates” participated in the Shakopee strike.\nSeveral politicians, including candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have expressed support for the Amazon workers.\nI stand in solidarity with @Amazon workers who are striking on #PrimeDay. Like all workers, they deserve safe working conditions, fair wages, and dignity and respect from their employer. I am proud of them for standing up for their rights and their families.\nThis story has been amended to include a Tuesday statement from Amazon.\nREAL LIFE. REAL NEWS.
