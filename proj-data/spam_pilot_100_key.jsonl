And Republicans sense a chink in the new president's armor.\r\n\"I'm sure that democrats, or at least the president is embarrassed by some of this,\" said Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz.\r\nAll sides now agree the President's stimulus bill won't survive in the form passed last week by House of Representatives (with only Democrats voting in favor).\r\nSupporters say that bill would create 3 million jobs. Detractors say it merely fulfills a long wish list of Democratic social reforms.\r\nA CBS News analysis finds that the resident's stimulus plan balloons virtually every federal agency in terms of dollars spent: $5.5 billion more for the Department of Commerce, $9.4 billion extra for the Environmental Protection Agency, $5 billion more for Labor, $1 billion for the Census and nearly $36 billion for Agriculture.\r\nAnd what about HHS, the agency Tom Daschle was slated to head before his withdrawal today? At least $21 billion for them, including $400 million for research, $60 million for environmental health, $50 million for \"injury prevention\" and to be distributed at the discretion of the HHS secretary.\r\nAll that has Republicans reaching for new ways to express numbers that defy imagination.\r\n\"If you took 100 dollar bills and wrapped them around the earth at the equator \u2026 It would go around the earth almost 39 times,\" said Sen. John Thune, R-S.D.\r\nThe president has been friendly enough, inviting some Republicans to cocktails, lunch and a Super Bowl party, even meeting with the Republican caucus on their own turf in the Capitol.\r\nBut the charm offensive hasn't risen above the political reality: Republicans were shut out of creating what's become \"The largest spending package probably ever in the history of the world,\" in the words of Republican Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C.\r\nToday, Senate Republicans began the push for what they call a simpler, more targeted stimulus bill.\r\nIt's a bout half the size of Mr. Obama's plan, much of which would be tax cuts and, they say, money that would address the mortgage crisis first.\r\n\u00a9 2009 CBS.

{"uid":"77cbdea1e68deabc13e4dace9776081d","content":"The U.K. is quitting coal. Poorer countries aren\u2019t.\r\nAnd poor ones do. How did that happen?\r\nSmoke rises from the cooling towers of coal-fired Cottam Power Station near Darlton, England, on April 17, 2015.\r\nThe United Kingdom announced last week its ambition to phase out the burning of coal by 2025. \u201cFrankly, it cannot be satisfactory for an advanced economy like the U.K. to be relying on polluting, carbon-intensive 50-year-old coal-fired power stations,\u201d Energy Secretary Amber Rudd said. Coal, which in the second quarter of 2015 accounted for just 21 percent of the U.K.\u2019s electricity, will be replaced by natural gas and renewables, unless coal-burning plants can figure out an effective way to capture carbon emissions.\r\nBut this move is more than symbolic. When a nation of 64.1 million people, the fifth-largest economy in the world, announces that it will boycott a product\u2014any product\u2014it has significant and immediate knock-on effects. In this case, it contributes to a largely unnoticed trend that is emerging both in the U.S. and across the globe. Increasingly, coal has become a class-based energy source. Wealthy regions, states, and cities are figuring out how to avoid using it, while poorer geographic areas are not.\r\nThe U.K.\u2019s move to go coalless will take less than 1 percent of global demand off the market. And as shocking as it seems, huge chunks of the world have yet to be adequately electrified. Many of the power plants that will turn on lights and run computers in India, China, and Africa in the coming decades will be fueled by coal. If India\u2019s coal consumption\u2014744 million short tons in 2014\u2014were to increase by just 10 percent, it would more than make up for the loss of England.\r\nSo why is this economically significant news? Coal is a commodity, but it\u2019s not as easily fungible as many others. Substantial investments went into the infrastructure (often financed by debt) that enables the movement of coal from where it\u2019s mined to where it\u2019s used today. (Hello, stranded assets!) And significant investments will be required to move coal from where it\u2019s mined to where it will be used tomorrow. You can\u2019t just flip a switch in a pipeline and start shipping coal to Mumbai instead of Middlesbrough.\r\nWhich is why even a relatively small reduction in consumption can have disproportionate impacts on individual companies and on national industries. In the U.S., for example, cheap natural gas and higher environmental standards (in that order) are slowly reducing coal\u2019s footprint in the energy mix. We\u2019re also seeing a lot of demand destruction; the Sierra Club\u2019s Beyond Coal campaign is documenting all the coal-burning plants that have closed or are slated for closure. Coal consumption in the U.S. fell by 19 percent between 2007 and 2014. That\u2019s a lot. But the Dow Jones U.S. Coal Index, which tracks the performance of U.S. coal stocks, is off about 95 percent since April 2011. That\u2019s catastrophic.\r\nThere\u2019s another important point to keep in mind. Whatever you make\u2014coal, watches, chocolate, cars\u2014 it\u2019s really important to have wealthy people and wealthy countries that are willing to buy it. And not just because that\u2019s where the money is. As the U.K. transitions away from coal, it will invest lots of money in replacements like natural gas, solar, wind, and energy efficiency. As it does so, it will create infrastructure, processes, and products that may help bring the cost of noncoal energy technologies down further.\r\nIn 2012, China and India combined to account for about 56 percent of global coal consumption. That percentage is climbing with each passing month. A world in which the U.K. is using no coal and the U.S. is using much less coal than it is now\u2014and in which China and India account for the bulk of consumption\u2014is one in which the prospects for a tax on carbon emissions, or taxes on coal imports and exports, or supra-regional cap-and-trade regimes, or limits on emissions from industries will become far more common.\r\nSo the major consequence isn\u2019t just the real demand destruction and economic dislocation that will come from the U.K. boycotting coal. Shorn of their dependence on the stuff for cheap power, the world\u2019s wealthy will use their power and money to embrace technologies, policies, and geopolitics that further tilt the table against coal. They already are.\r\nSlate is published by The Slate Group, a Graham Holdings Company. All contents \u00a9 2019 The Slate Group LLC.

Officers and guests from the Counselors\u2019 Office of the State Council, Center for International Cooperation (National Development and Reform Commission), World Bank, and China-Africa TEDA Investment Co., Ltd., witnessed and celebrated this memorable moment.\r\n\u201cForum on Industrial Zone Economy and Globalization\u201d was initiated by counselor Lin Yifu and Tang Min, and researcher Zuo Xiaolei, from the Counselors\u2019 Office of the State Council, which received high attention and positive responses from the School of Social Sciences, Tsinghua University. Under the guidance of \u201cOne Belt and One Road\u201d policy of focusing on developing the trade-industrial zones, this forum aims at building a communication platform for the information of development and construction of foreign industrial zones, integrating resources of enterprise, research institutes, and government departments, and provides intellectual support for national policies making.\r\nThe opening ceremony was hosted by deputy dean of the School of Social Sciences, Tsinghua University, Li Zhengfeng.

We should also provide new thoughts, strategies, and patterns along with the new world pattern.

As the first forum promoted by the Counselors\u2019 Office, the \u201cForum on Industrial Zone Economy and Globalization\u201d has significant meanings.\r\nCounselor Tang Min from the Counselors\u2019 Office of the State Council reviewed the background information of this forum and wished that this forum could combine large-scale communications with seminars following the lead of enterprises. Meanwhile, a distinctive and proper report should be published every year to help arrange thoughts. The Counselors\u2019 Office of the State Council will give this forum full support for its development. Counselor Zuo Xiaolei also expressed that the Counselors\u2019 Office would help enterprises to establish more policies for the construction of industrial zones.\r\nThe party secretary of the School of Social Sciences, Tsinghua University, Shi Zhiqin introduced the basic information of the School of Social Sciences and said that the opening ceremony of the \u201cForum on Industrial Zone Economy and Globalization\u201d was successfully held with the help and concern of the Counselors\u2019 Office of the State Council and Tsinghua University, with the joint efforts of the faculty and students of the School of Social Sciences.\r\nAssociate professor Tang Xiaoyang from Department of International Relations, School of&nbsp;Social Sciences,&nbsp;Tsinghua&nbsp;University, elaborated the ideas and design of \u201cForum on Industrial Zone Economy and Globalization\u201d. Then she had a full discussion with other participants.

The Big Ten Medal of Honor places equal importance on academics and athletics and pre-dates many of the biggest national awards that focus entirely on athletics, including the Heisman Trophy and Naismith Award.\r\nOver the past century, more than 1,300 student-athletes from Big Ten universities have earned this distinction. These individuals have translated their campus experience as student-athletes into success in all walks of life including medicine, science, politics, business and sports.\r\nSince 1896, the Big Ten has provided opportunities for students to earn a first-rate education. Ten member institutions rank in the top 31 of all public universities, and the Big Ten leads all conferences with more than 1,500 Academic All-Americans.&nbsp; Big Ten Medal of Honor winners embody this scholastic tradition and represent continued success following their education.\r\nAs part of the Big Ten Medal of Honor\u2019s historic anniversary, the conference is launching a 100-day campaign to help announce this year\u2019s honorees and celebrate the prominent winners of the past 99 years. The integrated effort, which begins this week and extends through June 18, includes profiling notable winners and stories each day on social channels and the conference website. Big Ten on-campus celebrations will feature past award recipients, recognition ceremonies and promotion of the award campus-wide.\r\nThe Best of the BestOut of the more than 8,200 student-athletes at the 12 Big Ten institutions, only 24 are recognized each year with the Big Ten Medal of Honor.\r\nTo learn more about the Big Ten Medal of Honor, visit bigten.org.

It is very close to the AI in BP: WiH with some added FSO 3.6.13 features. Especially AI controlled ships that have firing points far apart will greatly benefit from this AI. Readme included, so read it before whining. All hail Sushi and SCP.\r\nIt's not a big update from WiH, only minor tweaks and addition of FSO 3.6.13 features which aren't groundbreaking.

I guess he just put too many ships with those in one mission, this is usually what you get for going overboard with that kind of thing. IIRC, Fury's AI makes AI ships fire much faster than retail, even on Normal, which is why it showed up now (I'm supposed to be testing it on Insane, but I just can't get myself to fly these days. Don't worry, I'll get to it eventually).\r\nBetrayal is his middle name 211 Your local priest of cheeki breeki!\r\nWell... We actually have a few small BoE's in SG.

Over the last two days, they stayed busy meeting Lucidchart enthusiasts (and future Lucidchart enthusiasts) at our booth. When evening rolled around and other booths packed up, they stuck around to hand out swag and chat about the benefits of our web-based diagramming software.\r\nHowever, our team was able to stop by the keynote address from Werner Vogels, the CTO at Amazon.com and hear about some exciting developments, including a big launch involving Lucidchart. Read our take on the top announcements from AWS Summit.\r\nAWS Marketplace currently offers over 3,800 software listings and boasts 135,000 active customers, and Amazon\u2019s first big announcement will likely earn the AWS Marketplace new fans. With SaaS Contracts, you can now purchase your favorite software\u2014including Lucidchart!\u2014directly through AWS Marketplace. This addition gives you greater flexibility for subscriptions: Set the number of users and length of your contract, upgrade\/expand your contracts at any time, and view the charges right on your AWS bill.\r\nAmazon expects to offer even more options over the next few months, but we\u2019re happy to be one of the first 20 sellers to release a product as part of this launch. In addition to its intuitive nature and collaborative features, every Lucidchart account (including accounts purchased through AWS) includes our AWS import tool. Save time as you design your network and demonstrate compliance by importing your AWS infrastructure into Lucidchart. View additional metadata about each component, and see all connected components when you drag a shape onto the canvas.\r\nFor more information about Lucidchart SaaS Contacts, read our press release.\r\nIf you haven\u2019t purchased our diagramming tool yet, now is the time! Check out our listing on AWS Marketplace.\r\nGreat news\u2014this next announcement deals with the pain you\u2019ve felt as you set up new project environments and tried to collaborate with other team members. Collaboration is obviously near and dear to our hearts at Lucid Software, so we were excited to see Amazon\u2019s solution: AWS CodeStar.\r\nOnce you\u2019ve developed a responsive development workflow using AWS CodeStar, don\u2019t forget to visualize and store that process for future reference. Try it with Lucidchart.\r\nAmazon launched Redshift, a data warehousing service, back in 2012. While Redshift can hold an enormous amount of data, it takes time to load all that data and provide optimal query performance. So Amazon announced Redshift Spectrum, an extension of this popular service that customers can use to run complex queries directly on data stored in Amazon S3.\r\nEssentially, Redshift Spectrum offers a faster, more economical option for large-scale data queries. Vogels explained that an exabyte (that\u2019s one billion gigabytes) of data took five years for an older data warehouse to query, which costs a lot of money. With Spectrum, it takes 155 seconds to run the query.\r\nWe use Redshift at Lucid, and we have put a lot of time and effort into building tools to transfer data from S3 into Redshift and rebuilding data when clusters inevitably go down. Redshift Spectrum will save us time as we continue to build out our analytics infrastructure. Better performance. Lower cost. We love it, and so will you.\r\nAmazon has taken a few more steps forward in the world of artificial intelligence. Last year, when we went to AWS re:Invent, Amazon launched Amazon Lex as a preview. As of yesterday, it\u2019s available to all users so you too can harness the technology that makes Amazon Alexa run. Use automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language understanding (NLU) to build applications that support lifelike conversation.\r\nSince the launch last December, Amazon has added some new features to Lex, including Slack and Twilio integrations, SDK support, and preview response cards. For more information on these features, check out Amazon\u2019s announcement.\r\nThese updates are just another way that AWS has provided users with the necessary tools to focus less on the small stuff (like managing servers) and more on their businesses. We have to agree with Vogels\u2014if you are the James Bond of DevOps, then AWS is your intelligent, ever-helpful Q.\r\nIf you\u2019re looking for another way to make the most of your AWS experience, remember that you can semi-automatically build network diagrams of your AWS infrastructure in Lucidchart.

In recognition of her founding and growing the Metro Academies College Success Program (Metro), California State University (CSU) Chancellor Timothy P. White will honor Love with the Wang Family Excellence Award for Outstanding Faculty Innovator in Student Success on January 30, 2018.\r\nEstablished by CSU Trustee Stanley T. Wang and his family in 1998, the annual award recognizes four outstanding faculty members and one staff member in the CSU system who have distinguished themselves through exemplary achievements in various academic disciplines.\r\nLove founded Metro in partnership with City College in 2007 after noticing that many students entering the public health education major didn\u2019t have the tools they needed to succeed. With help from Vicki Legion, her counterpart at City College and director of the Metro Transfer Success program there, Love reconfigured the first two years of college. Metro creates student communities with shared academic or career interests in a \u201cschool within a school\u201d for up to 140 first generation, low-income or underrepresented students each year. The cohort of students enrolls together in two linked general education classes each semester during those two years. An engaging curriculum uses real-world challenges to strengthen the core academic skills of writing, quantitative reasoning, oral communications and critical thinking.\r\n\u201cCritical thinking and writing are skills that improve with repeated practice over time,\u201d said Love. \u201cThis curriculum provides students with the time and support they need to do that.\u201d Love says the curriculum empowers students to use their education to improve not only their own lives but also those of people in their communities and broader society. \u201cWe want to impart a love of learning and help them build a secure sense of self as scholars and agents of change,\u201d said Love. By discovering how learning is relevant to them and their families, the students become more excited about learning.","labels_spam":0,"labels_spam_vector":{"ads":0,"keyword_spam":0,"malicious_links":0}}

In the code I pasted above, I did something different. As you can see, I switched the order of the two so that $name would be equals to $first_name first, and then get updated in line 14 if the condition is true, thus avoiding the \"else\" statement.\r\nif the condition is == TRUE, like in this case, even though I think the code in the \"if\" statement in line 14 SHOULDN'T run, it runs, and the result is still \"Hampton Paulk\". And it remains \"Hampton Paulk\" no matter if the condition is set to TRUE or FALSE.\r\nIf the condition is ===TRUE, the opposite occurs. It doesn't matter whether you define \"USE_FULL_NAME\" as TRUE or FALSE, the condition in line 14 NEVER runs, and the name is just \"Hampton\" in both cases.\r\nif I set the condition == FALSE and set the USE_FULL_NAME to TRUE, the program works as intended. It displays the first name \"Hampton\" only. But if I set USE_FULL_NAME to FALSE, the condition should be met and it should display \"Hampton Paulk\", yet it doesn't, and it only displays \"Hampton\" regardless.\r\nWhy does this happen? What am I getting wrong in the order of operation?\r\nHi Marco, Did you noticed that your global variable is different: USE_FULL-NAME (hyphen '-') than global which was checked in the conditional statement: USE_FULL_NAME (underscore '_')?\r\nIt could be an explanation why this doesn't work as expected.

{"uid":"04f4a797a47e8330b12e5df3e77684f5","content":"Overview Over-pronation, or flat feet, is a common biomechanical problem that occurs in the walking process when a person?s arch collapses upon weight bearing. This motion can cause extreme stress or inflammation on the plantar fascia, possibly causing severe discomfort and leading to other foot problems. Causes There may be several possible causes of over pronation. The condition may begin as early as birth. However, there are several more common explanations for the condition. First, wear and tear on the muscles throughout the foot, either from aging or repetitive strain, causes the muscles to weaken, thereby causing the foot to turn excessively inward. Also, standing or walking on high heels for an extended period of time also places strain and pressure on the foot which can weaken the tissue. Lastly, shoes play a very common factor in the development of over pronation. Shoes that fail to provide adequate support through the arch commonly lead to over pronation. Symptoms Not all foot injuries affecting runners are necessarily down to a particular running gait; it is rarely that simple to diagnose how a foot problem developed . Simply being an overpronator does not mean that a foot injury has been caused by the running gait and it could be due to a number of factors. However mild to severe overpronators tend to be at a higher risk of developing musculoskeletal problems due to the increased stresses and strains which are placed on the body when the foot does not move in an optimum manner. The following injuries are frequently due to overpronation of the feet. Tarsal tunnel syndrome. Shin splints. Anterior compartment syndrome. Plantar fasciitis. Achilles tendonitis. Bunions. Sesamoiditis. Stress fractures. Back and hip pain. Ankle pain. Diagnosis A quick way to see if you over-pronate is to look for these signs. While standing straight with bare feet on the floor, look so see if the inside of your arch or sole touches the floor. Take a look at your hiking or running shoes; look for wear on the inside of the sole. Wet your feet and walk on a surface that will show the foot mark. If you have a neutral foot you should see your heel connected to the ball of your foot by a mark roughly half of width of your sole. If you over-pronate you will see greater than half and up to the full width of your sole. Non Surgical Treatment Overpronation is a term used to describe excessive flattening of the plantar arch. Pronation is a normal part of our gait (the way we walk), and it comprises three movements: dorsiflexion, eversion, and abduction. Dorsiflexion is the upward movement of the foot, eversion describes the foot rolling in, and abduction is ?out toeing,? meaning your toes are moving away from the midline of your body. When these three motions are extreme or excessive, overpronation results. Overpronation is very common in people who have flexible flat feet. Flatfoot, or pes planus, is a condition that causes collapse of the arch during weight bearing. This flattening puts stress on the plantar fascia and the bones of the foot, resulting in pain and further breakdown. Prevention Strengthen the glutes to slow down the force of the foot moving too far inward. Most individuals who over-pronate have weak glute muscles and strengthening this area is a must.

All rights reserved.\r\nTap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.\r\nA carpenter in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, works so handily with tools that you'd never guess he made his stylish tables and chairs with his feet.\r\nHe's Sintayehu Tishale, and this 42-year-old woodworker has been hammering away as one of the area's finest craftsmen for more than 20 years, according to Barcroft Media, a British news agency.\r\nTishale lost the use of his arms after being born with debilitating polio, but hasn't let that stop him from defying the odds to become a successful provider for his wife, Guday Agazu, 38, and their five kids.\r\nDespite his limited mobility, the skilled craftsman wields a hammer with incredible accuracy and can saw, chop, hammer, lathe wood and operate dangerous machinery with his dexterous feet, skills he taught himself as a child.\r\nTishale's family didn't notice their son's handy talents. Seeing no other employment prospects for him, they taught him to beg on the streets.\r\nThings changed 20 years ago when Tishale met his wife. The love of a good woman helped him turn his life around; he taught himself to read and write and dedicated his life to developing his woodworking skills.\r\nTishale now sticks out in his community more for his talent than for his appearance. But he's had to make some adaptations. He rides a specially adapted bicycle to get around and must limit himself to making certain types of furniture.\r\n\"Because of my physical limitations I can only make small pieces of furniture, stools and chests of drawers,\" he said. \"I sit on the floor so that I can stretch my legs out as far as possible.\r\nTishale is proud that he never let his disability hinder him from being a productive member of society and wants others in his situation to realize they have value beyond their disabilities. He's considered building a school.\r\nTishale's story is especially poignant to people like Tom Willis, who was born without any arms -- just a small left hand with two fingers that aren't very strong.\r\nBut that hasn't stopped him from leading a successful life, first as a producer of educational films and currently as a motivational speakerwho has made it his goal to throw out the first ball at every Major League Baseball stadium -- with his feet.\r\nWillis says that even though he grew up in the U.S., where there are more opportunities for the disabled than in Ethiopia, his story and Tishale's aren't so different.\r\n\"If you go in my garage you'll find power tools as well -- table saw, drill press, etc. -- I'm not the greatest, but I've built a few things in my day, too,\" he said.\r\nWillis says Tishale's story does help raise awareness in countries like Ethiopia that a disability doesn't mean a person has no value, but he adds it's hard to overcome a misconception that is centuries old.\r\nREAL LIFE.

The Alaafin said the rulers understood the financial situation of the country but needed to be provided with firsthand information on how the state was being run.\r\n\u201cWe were not invited for the budget presentation. If the government proposes to spend N165 billion in 2016 and the state is not financially buoyant, we want to know how government intends to generate the needed income to finance the budget expenditure.\r\n\u201cFor about three months, traditional rulers have not been getting funds from government. Though we recognize the current financial crisis in the nation, we are here to find out how the governor has been able to regularly pay the salaries and emoluments of members of the Council of Obas until the last three months.\r\nThe monarch applauded the governor for running the state without excessive borrowing.\r\nGovernor Ajimobi in his response urged the traditional rulers to encourage their subjects to pay tax as the state was projecting generating N5billion internally. He said that way, here would be no problem paying the salaries of the traditional rulers.\r\n\u201cWe have identified companies that have not paid tax for five years. Many house owners don\u2019t pay tenement rate. So, traditional rulers have to help speak to their people on the need to pay tax.\r\nMeanwhile, the Alaafin threw a lavished party when he turned 77 this year. He had a swell time with his teenaged wife who is also his last wife.\r\nTHANK YOU FOR YOUR SUBSCRIPTION!

As the nine-day mission proceeded, audio from mission control captured the drama as it unfolded\u2014 each moment revealing new dangers, new decisions and new wonders. For the first time on television, this documentary utilizes \u201clost tapes\u201d of the astronauts, recorded before and after the mission, along with rare film and photos.\r\nThe Americans were not the only ones trying for the moon in July of 1969...the Soviets were there, too. President Nixon had already prepared a eulogy for the possible death of the astronauts on their mission to the moon.\r\nThe documentary reveals the doubts and fears of the astronauts as they stood on the brink of history. The mission was nearly aborted twice, as the crew faced a mysterious alarm sounding in the spacecraft, and when fuel levels ran dangerously low.","labels_spam":0,"labels_spam_vector":{"ads":0,"keyword_spam":0,"malicious_links":0}}

It was reportedly the first major strike of Amazon workers in the U.S. during Prime Day, one of the company\u2019s biggest sales events of the year.\r\nThis year\u2019s Prime Day, which spans Monday and Tuesday, could rake in an estimated $5.8 billion in sales globally.\r\nSupporters of the picketers have reminded consumers that buying anything from Amazon on Prime Day would be crossing a digital picket line.\r\nPhotos taken outside the Shakopee warehouse show a few dozen protesters holding signs with phrases like \u201cWe\u2019re human, not robots.\u201d Some 100 to 200 workers had been expected to join the strike, which lasted six hours starting at 3 p.m. on Monday; but strikers claimed managers had intimidated workers from joining the walkout.\r\nThe Minnesota workers weren\u2019t the only ones to use Prime Day as an emphatic way to make their grievances with Amazon known.\r\nSome 2,000 Amazon workers at seven facilities in Germany walked out in protest of poor working conditions and low wages, CNBC reported. Amazon had said earlier that the German strike would not impact deliveries to customers.\r\nDemonstrations also took place in several American cities, including New York, San Francisco, Portland and Seattle, where Amazon\u2019s headquarters is located, to press the retail giant to stop selling technology to U.S Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Department of Homeland Security.\r\nThe Seattle Times noted that the U.K., Spain and Poland had Prime Day protests of their own.\r\nAmazon has repeatedly come under scrutiny over the years for subjecting warehouse workers to punishing working conditions, including instituting unreasonable quotas and making it difficult for employees to take adequate breaks or use the restroom.\r\nEarlier this month, late night host John Oliver devoted the majority of his show to calling out the retail giant for its questionable worker policies.\r\nAt the Shakopee facility, striking workers have expressed similar complaints.\r\nMeg Brady, a \u201crebinner\u201d at the warehouse, told The Washington Post this week that she\u2019s expected to handle 600 items per hour \u2015 a physically demanding task that she said caused a stress fracture in her foot.\r\n\u201cThey\u2019re working under insane deadlines, often in unsafe conditions,\u201d Liz Shuler of the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations said in a statement of the Minnesota workers.\r\n\u201cWe\u2019re standing strong in solidarity with the workers in Shakopee and beyond, but we hope you will too. When you stand up together collectively, that is how we change corporate behavior,\u201d she continued.\r\nAs CNBC noted, many workers at the Shakopee facility \u2015 the majority of whom are East African \u2015 have also complained that Amazon has been unwilling to accommodate their religious practices and holidays.\r\nStrike organizers said they want Amazon to \u201cprovide safe and reliable jobs, increase respect and opportunities for advancement for the predominantly East African workforce\u201d and \u201cprotect the right to organize and advocate for better working conditions,\u201d among other demands.\r\n\u201c[In] fact we already offer the things they purport to be their cause \u2014 industry leading pay of $15 per hour, benefits, and a safe workplace for our employees,\u201d the company said in an earlier statement.\r\nAn Amazon spokesman told HuffPost on Tuesday that \u201croughly 15 associates\u201d participated in the Shakopee strike.\r\nSeveral politicians, including candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Sen. Kamala Harris of California and Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, have expressed support for the Amazon workers.\r\nI stand in solidarity with @Amazon workers who are striking on #PrimeDay. Like all workers, they deserve safe working conditions, fair wages, and dignity and respect from their employer. I am proud of them for standing up for their rights and their families.\r\nThis story has been amended to include a Tuesday statement from Amazon.\r\nREAL LIFE. REAL NEWS.

Now, South Korean research supports the use of hyperbaric oxygen treatments to restore hearing in these patients.\r\nA review of the collected evidence suggests that -- added to standard drug therapy -- hyperbaric oxygen treatment \"is the most beneficial treatment option\" for what doctors call \"sudden sensorineural hearing loss,\" according to a team led by Dr. Tae-Min Rhee. He's a specialist in hyperbaric medicine at the National Maritime Medical Center in Seoul.\r\nOne expert in the United States explained that this type of sudden hearing loss is rare but very troubling to patients.\r\n\"Sensorineural hearing loss occurs in about 1 out of 10,000 people,\" said Dr. Darius Kohan, and is thought to be triggered by a viral infection or circulatory problems within the ear. Kohan directs otology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.\r\nHe said that 1 in every 3 people will get their hearing back without any treatment. For the other two-thirds of patients, drugs -- most often steroids -- are used, as well as hyperbaric oxygen.\r\nIn this treatment, patients are placed in a device that boosts oxygen levels in the inner ear.\r\nBut just how well does the therapy work? To find out, Rhee's group looked at data from 19 studies that compared outcomes for people with sensorineural hearing loss. Patients either received drug therapy alone or drug therapy plus hyperbaric oxygen. A total of more than 2,400 patients, averaging 45 years of age, were included.\r\nThe team found that people who got the combo therapy were 61 percent more likely to achieve complete hearing recovery compared to people who only got medicines. The average amount of hearing recovery was also higher, overall, for people who got both therapies rather than drugs alone.\r\nAlso, hyperbaric oxygen appeared most helpful for those patients who had experienced the most profound hearing loss.\r\nTherefore, adding hyperbaric oxygen therapy to steroids or other drug treatment seems to be a \"reasonable option\" for people with this form of sudden hearing loss, Rhee's team said.\r\nKohan did have a few caveats, however. First, he said the analysis couldn't control for certain variables -- the dosage and timing of drug treatment, for example, or the presence (or not) of vertigo or tinnitus (ringing in the ears), which often accompanies sudden hearing loss.\r\nFinally, there's the cost of hyperbaric oxygen therapy. The study found that benefits usually appeared after at least 20 hours of therapy, and Kohan noted that hyperbaric oxygen typically costs $300 per hour in the United States.\r\nThe findings were published Sept. 27 in JAMA Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.\r\nThe U.S. National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders has more about sudden hearing loss.\r\nCopyright \u00a92017 HealthDay.

All rights reserved.\r\nTap here to turn on desktop notifications to get the news sent straight to you.\r\nEarlier this year, Sen. Jay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.) speculated that the National Security Agency may have wiretapped him. His statement came at the very end of an interview in January with MSNBCs Chris Matthews and received little attention.\r\nMatthews asked Rockefeller about allegations that the NSA spied on journalists as part of its anti-terror surveillance. \"I'm quite prepared to believe it. I think they went after anybody they could get, including me,\" he said.\r\nMatthews was skeptical. \"They didn't eavesdrop on you, did they, senator?\" he asked.\r\n\"They sent me no letters,\" replied Rockefeller, meaning that he had no confirmation from the NSA that they had spied on him.\r\nHis speculation takes on much more significance in light of a New York Times report that the NSA attempted to spy on a congressman.\r\nA Huffington Post reader directed us to the Rockefeller remark. It was one among dozens of tips that HuffPost readers sent in after sifting through congressional records and searching for old news reports on Thursday. Reader research is resulting in a fairly comprehensive list, which we continue to update, of members of Congress who match the New York Times description of the congressman that the National Security Agency attempted to wiretap.\r\nThe Times reported that it couldn't identify the member but that he -- the paper used the term \"congressman\" -- had traveled on a congressional delegation to the Middle East in 2005 and 2006.\r\nThe Times' Eric Lichtblau, lead reporter on the story with James Risen, tells the Huffington Post he's pulling for our readers.\r\n\"Citizen journalism: If your readers can figure it out before us, that'd be great,\" Lichtblau says.\r\nThough the Times reported that one member was targeted, it's possible that others may have been as well. Using a bit of common sense, it's easy to tighten the circle of likely suspects.\r\nWe'll join him on that limb. The Times reported that the NSA official asserted that the member of Congress in question had \"contact...with an extremist who had possible terrorist ties.\" Presuming a Middle East connection, Democrats are more likely to have been in touch with such people because of contacts with Palestinian and Lebanese activists, which Republicans tend to avoid. Serious Palestinian activists are highly likely to have been in contact with officials from Hamas, the elected Palestinian leadership that was declared a terrorist organization by the U.S. government. Likewise, Lebanon's Hezbollah controls much of the southern region and holds a substantial number of seats in the Lebanese parliament. Contact with Hezbollah officials could raise the hackles of the NSA.\r\nA number of readers suggested Rep. Dennis Kucinich (D-Ohio), for this reason as well as his fervent opposition to the Bush administration and the war in Iraq, was a likely suspect. He traveled twice to the Middle East in 2005 and 2006, meeting with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, as well as activists in Lebanon, much to the chagrin of the White House at the time.\r\nOther readers suggested former Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D-Ga.) as a likely target. She lost her reelection bid in 2006 and have been a vocal supporter of the Palestinian people, even attempting to break through an Israeli blockade in 2008 to reach Gaza with a group of activists. McKinney, however, doesn't fit the Times' gender-specific description.\r\nA reader notes that Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) traveled to Syria and Lebanon in 2006 and met with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, which infuriated the Bush administration.\r\nRep. Henry Waxman (D-Calif.) was cited a number of times as a likely candidate. His position as chairman of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee during the Bush years certainly didn't endear him to the administration, but targeting a powerful committee chairman carries with it great risks. If you're the NSA, it's a good way to get your entire project shut down. For the same reason, it's also less likely Rep. George Miller (D-Calif.), a committee chairman and close ally of Pelosi, would have been targeted.\r\nReader Maggie Masar notes that then-Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) went on a codel to the Middle East in 2006. Is this the kind of terrorist tie they're looking for?\r\nGet HuffPost Politics on Facebook, or follow us on Twitter.\r\nREAL LIFE.

{"uid":"fef389db0d5e956e3375a63fd2f3ba62","content":"A growing number of educators concur that, in order to improve student academic performance, schools need to focus not only on students' academic needs but also on their social, emotional, and material needs (Piscatelli &amp; Lee, 2011). As a result, school climate--the social, emotional, and physical characteristics of a school community (Cohen, McCabe, Michelli, &amp; Pickeral, 2009)--is gaining more attention as a lever to improve student academic performance. Most studies on the relationship between school climate and academic performance assert that a more positive school climate promotes higher academic performance. But evidence of a relationship between the two is weak. These studies generally are based on data collected at a single point in time and compare academic performance across schools with different school climates. They show that academic performance is higher in schools with a more positive school climate at single points in time. However, little evidence exists that changes in school climate over time are associated with changes in academic performance. This study used grade 7 student data from the California Healthy Kids Survey and administrative data for approximately 1,000 middle schools in California for 2004\/05-2010\/11 to measure students' perceptions about six domains of school climate. Schools with a positive school climate were those in which students reported high levels of safety\/connectedness, caring relationships with adults, and meaningful student participation and low rates of substance use at school, bullying\/discrimination, and student delinquency. School-level academic performance was measured using grade 7 California Standards Test scores in English language arts and math. The study team examined the relationship between school climate and academic performance across schools to determine whether in a given year California middle schools with a more positive school climate had higher academic performance. The study team also sought to determine how academic performance for a given school improved as school climate improved by examining how changes in school climate over two-year intervals were related to changes in average academic performance. Key findings include: (1) Schools with a more positive student-reported school climate had higher academic performance in English language arts and math; (2) Changes in a school's student-reported school climate over time were associated with changes in academic performance at that school; and (3) The changes in academic performance within a school that were associated with changes in student-reported school climate over time were substantially smaller than the differences in academic performance across schools with different school climate values in a given year. For example, in a given year schools at the 50th percentile on school climate were at the 48th percentile on math performance, on average, while schools at the 60th percentile on school climate were at the 51st percentile on math performance. This finding suggests that an improvement of 10 percentile points in school climate would be associated with an average 3 percentile point increase in academic performance. However, when followed over time, schools with a 10 percentile point increase in student perceptions of school climate averaged a less than 1 percentile point increase in academic performance. The following are appended: (1) School climate domains measured on the California Healthy Kids Survey, grade 7 students; (2) Data and methodology; and (3) Cross-sectional and longitudinal associations between school climate and academic performance in percentile point and standard deviation metrics.","labels_spam":0,"labels_spam_vector":{"ads":0,"keyword_spam":0,"malicious_links":0}}

We just had a peaceful march yesterday and somebody comes and tags up on the wall,\" Muhamad Awadallah said in a video he took when he found \"Jesus is the way\" spray-painted on the front wall of the Islamic Center of Hawthorne.\r\nAnother Hawthorne mosque, about a mile from the Islamic center, was also vandalized. Crosses and the word \"Jesus\" were sprayed painted on the gate and windows.\r\nOfficers were called to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community Baitus-Salaam Mosque in the 13200 block of Prairie Avenue at 6:30 a.m. Sunday, according to the Hawthorne Police Department.\r\nWhen officers arrived, they discovered what appeared to be a hand grenade-type device in the driveway, along with graffiti sprayed on the fence of the property. The area was evacuated and the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Bomb Squad determined the device was a plastic replica of a hand grenade, officials said.\r\nAn image, which police said appeared to be a \"Jesus,\" was sprayed in white paint on the mosque's fence. The graffiti appeared to have occurred overnight.\r\nThe day before, Awadallah said they held a peaceful Christian and Muslim march.\r\n\"And today at five in the morning, we come to pray and we see that on the wall,\" Awadallah said.\r\nNormally, more than 50 people fill the mosque on Sunday nights for an Islamic class. After the vandalism, members said they were too scared to come.\r\nThe FBI released a statement regarding the incidents, saying Hawthorne police were leading the investigation, but federal authorities would review evidence in the case.\r\nBoth incidents are being classified as hate crimes.

A study released yesterday by the global wildlife NGO TRAFFIC suggests that most of Viet Nam\u2019s online illegal wildlife trade does not take place on websites ending in .vn, as previously thought, and instead monitoring efforts should focus on .com sites, and social media. The study, available online, is titled Viet Nam Online: A rapid assessment of e-commerce wildlife trade in Viet Nam in 2017.\r\nIt monitored 13 websites ending in .vn using keyword searches for products like elephants, leopards, pangolins, rhinos, and tigers.\r\nOf the websites surveyed, 30% were found to have advertisements for these vulnerable and exploited animals. A total of 14 advertisements in all offered 1,072 selected wildlife products. All but six of the advertised products were made from elephant ivory, with the remainder coming from tigers. This is in contrast to similar surveys previously conducted of Viet Nam\u2019s online wildlife trade that have included .com domain names, including social media websites, that discovered many more advertisements for wildlife products.\r\nThey include a 2017 TRAFFIC survey that found about 1100 tiger products offered for sale in 187 advertisements from 85 unique sellers on four e-commerce websites and two social media websites over a period of 25 days. Online trade in Viet Nam is regulated by law. People who break it can be punished with the same severity as people who sell illegal wildlife products in a physical marketplace. However, collecting evidence and prosecuting online crime can be very difficult, and Vietnam prosecutes few wildlife crimes.\r\nThe report recommends the Vietnamese government adapt to ensure effective law enforcement across online channels.\r\n* These fields are required.\r\nDonate with confidence \u2013 we are a registered charity and you can view our annual reports here.","labels_spam":0,"labels_spam_vector":{"ads":0,"keyword_spam":0,"malicious_links":0}}
